## What is this madness?

It's a markdown editor so you can see in real time what your markdown will look like without having to go through multiple rounds of saving and checking to see if you got it just right. Just start typing in the left hand panel and watch it appear like magic on the right hand pane.

## Install & Run

After cloning down the app to your computer navigate to the projects root directory and run the following commands:

```
  $ npm install
  $ node app / npm start
```
